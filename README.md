Magik Erik Tower Defense
===========
You are the the Tektonic Knights, masters of technology. As you journey from land to land, harvesting resources as you explore the universe, an anomalous planet drew your attention. You land your space-faring city on a promising patch of land, and suddenly experience massive system failures. As your scanners come back online, you see a hideous, bespectacled monster, waving its arm-like appendages in the air. Your speakers pick up shouts that sound something like "Mine mine mine, mine mine mine, mine mine mine mine!!!" Behind the shouting creature, an endless tide of hideous monsters surge in the direction of your precious city. 

Engineers double their efforts to determine the cause of the massive system failures, so that they can send Tektonic City back into the skies. Your job is to just keep the locals at bay long enough for your civilization to escape.

Good luck.
